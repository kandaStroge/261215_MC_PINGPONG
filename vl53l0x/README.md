Based on the VL53L0X library for the Arduino by Pololu. See the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/pololu/vl53l0x-arduino) 

## Summary

This is a library for the VL53L0X time-of-flight distance sensors. It is a port from the Arduino library to CCS's PIC-C compiler for use with Microchip PICs. The library targets the PIC16F886 but it should work with any other PICs with more than 4K flash memory, including PIC18s and PIC24s. 

## Getting Started

Please take a look at the single.c file for a simple example.
More details about the library can be found on the original [Arduino repository](https://github.com/pololu/vl53l0x-arduino) .
